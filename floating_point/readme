This is just a quick look at a trivial floating point problem wherein
various machines and architectures mat represent the data in very
different ways. Also we see a total failure on a trivial addition
merely because the precision is entirely too low to allow for such
and addition. 

To make life easy we will need a cross platform aware binary or hex
data printout function. This function must be aware if the system
is a little endian or big endian memory architecture and then output
the memory data correctly.
