Trivial bit of code that will print out the current
gmp and mpfr library versions. 

Also for fun we print out pi  and e with whatever
precision we can get up to a billion digits or so.

Even the slowest machine that we can find will 
easily compute pi and e to a million digits in less
than an hour : 

C_esther$ 
C_esther$ /usr/bin/time -p /usr/bin/nice -n +15 ./mpfr_ver 3322000 2>&1 | tail -4 

real 2393.49
user 2363.55
sys 3.75
C_esther$
