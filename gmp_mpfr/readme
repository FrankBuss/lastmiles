Trivial bit of code that will print out the current
gmp and mpfr library versions. 

Also for fun we print out pi with whatever precision
we can get up to 384 bits or so. 

Also from a billion digits of pi we see the following 
digit counts : 

    0 99993942
    1 99997334
    2 100002410
    3 99986912
    4 100011958
    5 99998885
    6 100010387
    7 99996061
    8 100001839
    9 100000273
