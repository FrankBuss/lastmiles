Finally try to get the ray trace code to actually trace some data
and report visual data and then start using threads also. 

Here we just start with the X11 harness that was written in the
xwin directory and continue onwards wwith some bulk computations
being done on regions of the viewport. 

We may also implement a mouse scroll wheel event wherein the viewport
is moved forwards or backwards in the viewport tangent normal direction
and we really don't know much about the delta distance yet.
