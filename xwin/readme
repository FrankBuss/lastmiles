Look around for whatever compiler you have on hand and set
the env var : 

CC=/usr/bin/gcc-9

Be sure to select CFLAGS that make sense for you machine : 

CFLAGS=-std=iso9899:1999 -m64 -O0 -g -march=k8 -mtune=k8 -fno-fast-math -fno-builtin

This is critical for clock_gettime and possibly other items that are 
cross platform safe within the POSIX spec world : 

CPPFLAGS=-D_TS_ERRNO -D_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_X_OPEN_SOURCE=600 -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=199309L

None of this will work very well if you don't have a display : 

DISPLAY=localhost:10.0

That could be as trivial as :0 on your machine in front of you.
