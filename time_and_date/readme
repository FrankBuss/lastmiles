we play around with the leap year problem and 
determine what are valid dates and also how 
to set a locale inside software.

Fri Aug 16 23:49:03 GMT 2019
We covered UTF-8 options and then built three
code chunks to check for valid dates and also 
another to print out the locale aware date in
some strftime format. 

Please note the use of calloc() and mktime().
