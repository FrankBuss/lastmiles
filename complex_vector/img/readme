Lenna or Lena is the name given to a standard test image widely used in
the field of image processing since 1973. It is a picture of the Swedish
model Lena SÃ¶derberg, shot by photographer Dwight Hooker, cropped fro
the centerfold of the November 1972 issue of Playboy magazine.
The spelling "Lenna" came from the model's desire to encourage the
proper pronunciation of her name. "I didn't want to be called Leena"
